This project is not just about coding but about creating **awareness**.  
It reminds us that civic sense is not optional – it is about:

- 🚮 Respecting public property  
- 🚦 Following rules & laws  
- 🌍 Treating foreigners with dignity  
- 🇮🇳 Representing our country responsibly  

💡 *Awareness alone may not change society overnight, but small steps lead to big impacts when we act together.*
