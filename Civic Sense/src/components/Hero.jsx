              Civic sense means respecting public spaces, following rules, and caring for the
              community around us. It is the practice of keeping our surroundings clean, behaving
              responsibly in society, and treating others with respect. Civic sense is about
              discipline, consideration for others, and living as responsible citizens. It includes
              simple actions like obeying traffic rules, not littering, standing in queues, and
              respecting public property. In short, civic sense is nothing but common sense applied
              in public life.

              Why is Civic Sense Important?
            </h1>

              Civic sense is the foundation of a safe, clean, and well-functioning society. Without
              civic sense, rules are broken, cities become dirty, and chaos replaces order. It
              ensures harmony, respect, and safety in our day-to-day interactions. A lack of civic
              sense not only affects others but also comes back to hurt us as citizens. Nations are
              judged not just by their economy, but by the civic behavior of their people. Civic
              sense helps build trust, unity, and dignity in society. The small habits of
              individuals create the big image of a nation.
